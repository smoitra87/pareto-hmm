  abstract = {Biologists working in the area of computational protein design have
	never doubted the seriousness of the algorithmic challenges that
	face them in attempting in silico sequence selection. It turns out
	that in the language of the computer science community, this discrete

	explain the context of this observation, to provide a simple illustrative
	proof and to discuss the implications for future progress on algorithms
	for computational protein design.},
