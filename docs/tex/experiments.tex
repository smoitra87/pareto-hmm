\section{Experiments}
In this section we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on simulated as well as experimental data. 

\subsection{Simulation Experiments}
We run a variety of different simulation experiments to check the performance of our algorithm on 

\subsubsection{Sim Experiment 1}
\label{sim:toy}
We demonstrate how our algorithm performs on simulated data. The data was prepared by considering a protein of length 12. The sequence space was limited to an alphabet consisting of two arbitrary characters $\alpha,\beta$. The observation belong to a discrete space Helix, Beta and Loop which represented by H,B and L. The weights of the CMRF have weights $\phi,\psi$ as defined in Tables~\ref{tab:psi1} and~\ref{tab:psi2}. We define two states State A and State B that corresponding to competing objectives for multistate design. State A is a Helix-Loop-Helix strand whereas State B is Sheet-Loop-Sheet strand. Figure~\ref{fig:simstates} shows a cartoon diagrams for our design problem. State A and State B have \texttt{HHHHLLLLHHHH} and \texttt{BBBBLLLLBBBB} secondary structure features respectively. These are the observations for the CMRF.
\\
\\
Using the weight matrices we defined in Tables~\ref{tab:psi1} and~\ref{tab:psi2} we run CMRF-Decode to get $X_A$ which satisfies $X_A = \argmin_X E_A(X)$. We obtain $X_B$ similarly. Not surprisingly $X_A$ is $\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha$ 
and $X_B$ is $\beta\beta\beta\beta\beta\beta\beta\beta\beta\beta\beta\beta$. This is because the weights in the table are biased towards $\alpha$ emitting \texttt{H} and $\beta$ emitting \texttt{B}. Thus according to our model $X_A$ is the sequence that is most stable under state A, whereas $X_B$ is the sequence is most stable under state B.
\\
\\
We then run the \texttt{Pareto-Frontier} algorithm using the same weights and observations for state A and state B to enumerate the entire pareto frontier. This pareto frontier contains all the best sequences that any convex combination of $E_A(X)$ and $E_B(X)$ would give rise to. We number the points to show the path taken by the pareto frontier algorithm. We also calculate the energies of all the $2^{12}$ sequences possible under this restricted sequence model and plot the points. The \texttt{Pareto-Frontier} algorithm was able to find the pareto frontier in \textcolor{red}{1 step} steps. See Figure~\ref{fig:pareto-sim} for the trace taken by the algorithm.  We also compare the running times as opposed to brute force and MCMC and compare the running times.

\subsubsection{Simulation Experiment 2}
\label{sim:randprobs}
In this example we look at a slightly more complicated energy frontier. To generate this energy surface we resorted to generating random emission and transition probabilities till we found a sufficiently complicated energy frontier but still having alphabet \texttt{\{a,b\}} and feature space \texttt{\{H,L,B\}}. The probabilities for this simulation experiment are shown in tables~\ref{tab:psi3} and~\ref{tab:psi4}.

\subsubsection{Simulation Experiment 3: Random probs tied}
\label{sim:randprobstied}
In this experiment we use a 12 length sequence. We do 2-state design using features \texttt{HHHHLLLLHHHH} and \texttt{BBBBLLLLBBBB} as before. The sequence space is restricted to a dummy \texttt{\{a,b\}}  We randomize the emission and transition probabilities. The parameters of the emission and the transition are ties together.  We store the frontier, frontier energies, computation time taken and 

\subsubsection{Simulation Experiment 4:Random probs untied}
\label{sim:randprobsuntied}
Same as Simulation~\ref{sim:randprobstied} with the difference that the emission and the transition probabilities are untied. 

\subsubsection{Simulation Experiment 5 : Random feature space tied}
Like~\ref{sim:randprobstied} but the feature space is randomized while the parameters between differnent amino acids are tied together. 
\label{sim:randfeatstied}

\subsubsection{Simulation Experiment 6 :  Random feature space untied}
Like~\ref{sim:randprobsuntied} but the feature space is randomized while the different amino acids are untied. This is the most general of the previous settings.

\subsubsection{Simulation Experiment : K-way multistate design}

\subsubsection{Simulation Experiment 11 : Augmenting Feature space}

\subsection{Benchmarking with other Methods}

\subsection{Experiments on Biological Data}
In this section we apply our algorithm to biological sequence data. These are the following main steps required : 

\begin{itemize}
\item Create alignments of sequences 
\item Train HMM from the alignment
\item Convert HMM representation to CMRF
\item Choose design state and corresponding features
\item Run algorithm to decode sequence
\end{itemize}

We have the following sources of information from the various databases : 

\begin{itemize}
\item pdb - pfam map
\item pdb - scop - pdb list map
\item pdb - sec structure map
\item pdb - seq map
\item pdb - pdb structure 
\item pfam - pdb 
\item pfam - uniprot (alignments)
\end{itemize}

There can be a number of different schemes that can be used for running biological experiments. 

\paragraph{Tied - SCOP} This scheme is the simplest of all. Try to find a number of proteins that belong to a particular protein fold. There should be sequence and structure information available for all these structures. Find the transition probabilities of these sequences and the corresponding sec. structure features. Use these to learn $P(X)$ and $P(X1|X2)$ and $P(O|X)$ that are tied for all amino acid positions. Find the 3D features of the states you are interested in designing. Could be the two states of Zif268 and Trimeric or Janus series or disordered proteins. 

\paragraph{Seq untied, features tied - PFAM/SCOP} -Similar to previous scheme but with sequence weights untied. We obtain PFAM alignments for the states in questions. Combine the alignments. Learn P(X) and P(X1|Xj). P(O|X) is learned from a general SCOP superfamily. Find 3D features of all positions you are interested in. Make sure that gaps and dummy features are handled carefully. Decode on a possibly larger HMM than the sequence desired because the MSA is bigger. 

\paragraph{Seq untied, features partially untied - PFAM/SCOP} - An effort is made to untie 3D features. Instead of having a uniform $P(O|X)$ for all sequence positions. Whichever sequences in alignment have 3D information, those sequences then bias $P(O|X)$ for that position. 

\paragraph{Seq, features untied - PDB Blast} - All sequence positions are untied. PDB is blasted to find all sequences that match given region of interest. 

\paragraph{No Joint alignment} - Have different alignments for the different states and learn separate HMMs for each of these. The algorithm needs to be modified in order to perform decoding on these. 

\paragraph{Augment Feature space discrete features} - Augment the feature space with other discrete features. 

\paragraph{Augment feature space real features }  - Augment feature space with real valued features. Condition on them using Bayes theorem and some a distribution such as the gaussian. 

\subsubsection{Tied SCOP Zif268-Trimer}
\label{exp:tied_scop_multistate}
For multistate design we will look try to design for two states Zif268(zic-finger like) and a trimeric coiled coil. Specifically we will consider the structures of hemaglutinin(13-44) pdb id 1HTM and Zif268 zinc-finger DNA complex(pdb id: 1AAY). 1HTM belongs to the PF00509 family which has 232 structures. 1AAY belongs to PF00096 family which has 19 structures. These sets are expanded by considering the SCOP family that they belong to. 1AAY belongs to the Zif268 domain which has 14 structures and the zinc finger family which has 70 structures. 1HTM belongs to influenza hemagluttinin family and domain which have 39 structures both. In order to train the hmm, one can learn the transition and emission probabilities of the region under consideration, the whole protein. One can also choose to learn these weights from just the PFAM or just the scop data or both combined. We will explore each of these cases. 


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pics/bio1_ziftied_0.pdf}
    \caption{Tied SCOP Zif268-Trimer. Basically this does not really work since all the params are tied together. It prefers repeated amino acids, which is not really what it is supposed to do. }
    \label{fig:tied_zif}
\end{figure}

We use all the sequences and secondary structures of SCOP fold of the protein under consideration. For 1HTM it is the 'Stalk segment of viral fusion proteins' fold. For 1AAY it is 'beta-beta-alpha zinc fingers' fold. 
While training the HMM we deduplicate all sequence, sec. structure pairs. All X and U amino acids are not considered. We add a 5\% bias to all background to match background frequencies. This is done by : 
\[
P(O=a|X=b) = \frac{Count(O=a,X=b)+Count(O=a)\times 0.05}{Count(X=b)+Count(O)\times 0.05}
\]

See Figure~\ref{fig:tied_zif} for results. Basically, the sequences are of poor quality since they are repeated. 


\subsubsection{Untied SCOP-PFAM Zif268-Trimer}
\label{exp:untied_scop_zif}


\subsubsection{Tied SCOP - Disordered proteins}
\label{exp:tied_scop_disordered}
The goal is to be able to find where known disordered proteins lie on the sequence space defined by the family of disordered proteins. To do this we first obtain sequences corresponding to the family of disordered   proteins probably from SCOP. The sequences are examined to learn transition probabilities and begin probabilities. The pdb structures are examined to find the amino acid to secondary structure counts. The Emission and transition tables are filled in. 

There is no concept of gaps here. It is possible that different sequence lengths correspond to different energy values, sop the scores must be normalized to the length of the target design sequences. The decoding is performed and sequences are examined with respect to the pareto-frontier. 


\subsubsection{Untied SCOP Partial - Disordered proteins}
\label{exp:untied_scop_disordered}
The goal here is the same as in section~\ref{exp:tied_scop_disordered}. However we will do away with the concept of tied position independent hmms. Instead we will create a giant alignment of all PFAM/SCOP sequences corresponding to these fellows. We will use background frequencies of amino acids and features and use them as pseudo-counts. Those sequences that have pdb structures will be used to bias the emission probability weights where suitable. There will be a lot of aligning and re-aligning going on. So it will help to make sure that all this is taken care off properly.
